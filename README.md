## TextPipeline

## Overview
TextPipeline is tailored for handling text data, providing tools for preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. Ideal for natural language processing (NLP) projects.
## Features

- Text cleaning and preprocessing
- Tokenization and feature extraction
- Model training
- Model evaluation
- Saving and loading models


## Installation
```bash
pip install textpipeline
```
    
## Usage/Examples

```python
from textpipeline import TextPipeline

# Initialize the pipeline
pipeline = TextPipeline(config_path='config.yaml')

# Load data
pipeline.load_data('data/raw/text_data.txt')

# Preprocess text
pipeline.preprocess()

# Feature extraction
pipeline.feature_extraction()

# Train model
pipeline.train_model()

# Evaluate model
pipeline.evaluate_model()

# Save the model
pipeline.save_model('models/trained_model.pkl')
```


## Configuration
Refer to the `config.yaml` file for customizing preprocessing steps, feature extraction methods, and model parameters.
